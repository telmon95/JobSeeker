## üöÄ About This Project

JobSeeker AI is a full-stack web application designed to streamline and automate the modern job search. It leverages a suite of powerful APIs to source relevant job postings, parse user CVs to extract structured data, and generate tailored cover letters using artificial intelligence. This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end development cycle, from backend architecture and third-party API integration to a responsive and interactive React frontend.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Secure User Authentication:** Full registration and login system using JWT for protected routes and persistent user sessions.
*   **Automated CV Parsing:** Users can upload their CV (PDF, DOCX), which is processed by the **Affinda API** to extract skills, work experience, and contact information into a structured JSON format.
*   **Multi-API Job Aggregation:** The platform fetches job listings from multiple professional sources (**Adzuna** and **Jooble APIs**), normalizes the data, and de-duplicates the results to provide a comprehensive and relevant job feed.
*   **AI-Powered Cover Letter Generation:** Integrates with the **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-Turbo)** to generate unique, professional cover letters tailored to a specific job description and the user's parsed CV data.
*   **Experimental Auto-Apply:** A foundational feature using **Puppeteer** to automate the process of filling out job applications on external career pages, demonstrating advanced browser automation skills.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Installation

To run this project on your local machine, you will need two separate terminal windows (one for the `client` and one for the `server`).

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/telmon95/JobSeeker.git
cd JobSeeker
2. Backend Setup:
code
Bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Create the environment variables file
# (On Mac/Linux)
cp .env.example .env
# (On Windows, manually create .env and copy content from .env.example)

# Add your secret keys to the .env file (see section below)

# Start the backend development server
npm run dev
3. Frontend Setup (in a new terminal):
code
Bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
The application should now be running. The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 and the backend will be running on http://localhost:5001.
üîë Environment Variables
The backend requires a .env file located in the /server directory. This file stores all required secret keys and API credentials.
